# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built using the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** design pattern, where two players can compete, keeping track of scores and displaying the results at the end of the game.

## Requirements

- **Web browser** (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- **Text editor** (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.) for viewing and editing code (optional)

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the game layout and UI.
- **CSS**: For styling the game board, buttons, and player information.
- **JavaScript**: The core functionality of the game, including game logic, UI interactions, and updates.
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: A software design pattern used to separate concerns in the application (Model for logic and data, View for UI, and Controller for handling events).
- **DOM Manipulation**: JavaScriptâ€™s ability to interact with the HTML document to update the UI dynamically.
